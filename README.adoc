Computer, tell me why I am

Not content or in love with

A simple feeling

I ask for I have lost my sense of

Peace and you are extraordinarily clever

== Overview

This material is for my workshop on crafting AI at link:https://future.works/tech-conference[Future.Works] tech conference.

[IMPORTANT]
.Come prepared
====
Follow the steps below through installation, all the way to running the IDE.
This ensures that the dependencies are loaded on your machine before
joining the conference WLAN, which may get congested if we all start downloading at once.

We will investigate General Problem Solver (GPS) in the session. We will implement the GPS in Clojure, and apply it to two example problems:

- link:https://github.com/norvig/paip-lisp/blob/master/docs/chapter4.md#44-stage-4-test[Driving to Nursery School]
  * link:./src/scenarios/school.clj[School scenario as Clojure data]
- link:https://github.com/norvig/paip-lisp/blob/master/docs/chapter4.md#412-the-new-domain-problem-monkey-and-bananas[Monkey and Bananas].
  * link:./src/scenarios/monkey.clj[Bananas scenario as Clojure data]

Our solution will draw inspiration from the GPS implementation in link:https://github.com/norvig/paip-lisp[Paradigms of Artificial Intelligence Programming: Case Studies in Common Lisp by Peter Norvig (1992)].

I will code live. Clone this repo to follow along on your own machine.

== Install dev tools

We will be using link:https://clojure.org/[Clojure] in this workshop. You will need Java and either Clojure CLI tools (Mac and Linux) or Leiningen (Windows).

=== Linux and Mac

- Java and JDK (Required)
* Check that you have at least Java 8 on command line with `java --version`
* If needed, install Java. OpenJDK works well: https://openjdk.java.net/install/
- Clojure CLI tools (Required)
* https://clojure.org/guides/getting_started#_clojure_installer_and_cli_tools
* Verify that `clj` on command line opens a Clojure prompt. Close with Ctrl+D.

=== Windows

- Install Java and JDK as above.
- Leiningen (Optional. Required for Windows.)
* https://leiningen.org/

== Run development environment

We'll use the in-browser IDE link:https://sekao.net/nightlight/[Nightlight] in this workshop.

=== CLI tools (Linux and Mac)

    clj -M -m nightlight.core

=== Leiningen (Windows)

    lein nightlight
